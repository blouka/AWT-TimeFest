					<p>East Dance played host to heavyweights Fatboy Slim, Carl Cox, Professor Green and Pete Tong as well as memorable live appearances from Ke$ha, Fenech-Soler and Azari and III. Away from the main stages, the Kidz Field – this year playing host to tot heroes The Gruffalo and Rastamouse – was a world of inspiring invention, bustling with kid-friendly mayhem. In the Circus tent, No Fit State Circus redefined the genre with their frenetic and jaw-dropping show.</p>

It was a welcomed warmth that awoke the grass and brought a bright new buzz to the previous-days’ bedraggled. Blur’s rough diamond, Graham Coxon, and New York’s new wave stalwarts, The Walkmen, rocked The Park stage before the day’s Special Guests, Pulp, delighted record crowds with a triumphant greatest hits set. At the John Peel Stage, Noah And The Whale lead a rousing sing-along while at the Pyramid, Elbow delivered a deep, happy sigh of a set matched in beauty only by the setting sun which it soundtracked. Coldplay followed and in their charming, inimitable way, played a thrillingly-paced, momentous show, lighting up the Pyramid stage both metaphorically and, for the first time, literally. Over the way, The Chemical Brothers ignited the Other Stage with their explosive day-glo beats and propulsive rhythms.<br><br>

        <p>Later in the valley, as Pyramid headliner Beyoncé belted-out bootilicious platinum chart-toppers, on the Other Stage, Queens Of The Stone Age offered a raucous adrenalin-fuelled antidote to Mrs Z’s feisty tunes. Above the writhing bacchian mass, up on the sloping hillsides, the enchanting wonky world of The Park was perfectly soundtracked by Sunday night’s headliner, Welsh psychedelic pop-meister Gruff Rhys. From there, high over the site the picture was perfect. Pastel skies prevailed as a crystalline sun set on another great year.
